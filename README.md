# CST-315: Operating Systems Lecture & Lab Projects

This repository contains the completed projects for CST-315: Operating Systems Lecture & Lab, a 4-credit course that covers the concepts, structure, and mechanisms of modern operating systems. The projects reinforce and expand learning of principles introduced in the lecture, with a focus on hands-on activities that implement various aspects of operating systems, such as process management, file management, and I/O management.

## Running the Programs
To run any of the projects, you will need to have g++ and gcc installed. No non-default libraries are needed.

1. Download the repository zip file.
2. Unzip the file and locate the .cpp or .c file for the project you wish to run.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the location of the file.
4. For a .cpp file:
   - Run `g++ -o [Executable FileName] project_file_name.cpp` to generate an executable with the desired filename.
   - Run `./[FileName]` to run the program.
5. For a .c file:
   - Run `gcc -o project_file_name.c -o [Executable FileName]` to generate an executable with the desired filename.
   - Run `./[FileName]` to run the program.
